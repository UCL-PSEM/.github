# UCL Dept of Population Science and Experimental Medicine

## Welcome to the PSEM GitHub Page

Our department brings together world-leading researchers to explore the causes, consequences, and prevention of cardiometabolic and other ageing-related diseases.

Our department includes the following groups:

- The [Unit for Lifelong Health & Ageing at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/cardiovascular/research/research-department-population-science-and-experimental-medicine/unit-lifelong-health-and-ageing-ucl) (the home of the [Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) Birth Cohort](https://nshd.mrc.ac.uk/) and [Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE)](https://www.sabrestudy.org/) studies)
- The [Centre for Translational Genomics](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/cardiovascular/research/research-department-population-science-and-experimental-medicine/centre-translational-genomics)
- The [Multimorbidity Mechanisms and Therapeutics Collaborative (MMTRC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/cardiovascular/research/research-department-population-science-and-experimental-medicine/multimorbidity-mechanisms-and-therapeutics-research-collaborative).
- [The Bloomsbury Centre for Clinical Phenotyping (BCCP)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/cardiovascular/research/research-department-population-science-and-experimental-medicine/bloomsbury-centre-clinical-phenotyping/bccp-facilities)

Activities in the department range from discovery science, through detailed cardiometabolic phenotyping, to policy-influencing research.

## Using This Site

These pages are still in development, but over time aims to build a collection of resources that may aid members of both PSEM and the wider scientific community in their research.

These will include scripts and documentation relevant (but not limited) to:

- `PSEM Cohorts` Resources which may be helpful for people working with NSHD or SABRE data
- `CLS Cohorts` Resources which may be helpful for people working with NCDS, BCS70, MSC, or Next Steps data
- `UK Biobank` Resources which may be helpful for people working with UK Biobank data
- `Epidemiology Scripts and Workflows` Resources which may be helpful for people conducting epidemiological research in programmes like R or Stata
- `Genetic Epidemiology Scripts and Workflows` Resources which may be helpful for people conducting geneticepidemiological research in programmes like PLINK or PRSice
- `Data Collection and Analysis Scripts and Workflows` Resources which may be helpful for people working on raw data output in programmes like Matlab
- `Scripts from Published Papers` Open access scripts published alongside peer-reviewed PSEM papers
